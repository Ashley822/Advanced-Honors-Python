In a regular BST, insertions and deletions do not ensure height balance, leading to cases where the tree could become skewed. 
In an AVL tree, after every insertion or deletion, the code check the balance factor of each node. If the tree becomes unbalanced, rotations will be performed to restore balance. This ensures that the tree remains balanced.
